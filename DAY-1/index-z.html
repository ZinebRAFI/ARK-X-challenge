    <h2>Timeline of Homer's Life:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8th century BCE - Homer is believed to have lived during this period.</li>
        <li>He composed the epic poem "The Iliad," depicting the events of the Trojan War.</li>
        <li>He composed the epic poem "The Odyssey," narrating the adventures of Odysseus on his journey back home after the Trojan War.</li>
        <li>His works have a profound influence on ancient Greek literature and culture, as well as on Western literature as a whole.</li>
        
    </ul>

        He is also one of the most influential authors in the widest sense, for the two epics provided the basis of Greek education and culture throughout the Classical age and formed the backbone of humane education down to the time of the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity. Indirectly through the medium of Virgilâ€™s Aeneid (which was loosely molded after the patterns of the Iliad and the Odyssey), directly through their revival under Byzantine culture from the late 8th century CE onward, and subsequently through their passage into Italy with the Greek scholars who fled westward from the Ottomans, the Homeric epics had a profound impact on the Renaissance culture of Italy. Since then the proliferation of translations has helped to make them the most important poems of the Classical European tradition.
